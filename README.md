### Creating a Mutual Fund Plan


### Project Overview

- Mutual funds are investment plans that pool money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other securities, managed by professional fund managers. A mutual fund plan is created by selecting the stocks where an investor can benefit in the long term.

  
### Steps followed
- Step 1: Gather historical stock data, such as closing prices and growth trends over time.
- Step 2: Calculate key metrics like Return on Investment (ROI) and volatility (risk) to understand how each stock has performed historically.
- Step 3: Choose stocks that have a high ROI and low volatility to ensure a balance between risk and reward.
- Step 4: Calculate the future value of monthly investments based on the expected ROI of the selected stocks.

### Summary
- This project shows how a mutual fund plan is designed by investment companies for long-term investors. Mutual funds are investment plans that pool money from multiple investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other securities, managed by professional fund managers.
